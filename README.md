Task 1_ Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset
**Objective:**  
Understand the structure, relationships, and distribution of variables in a classic dataset.

**Approach:**  
- Loaded the Iris dataset using `pandas`.  
- Explored dataset structure using `.shape`, `.columns`, and `.head()`.  
- Created visualizations:
  - Scatter plots to analyze relationships between sepal and petal dimensions.
  - Histograms to examine distributions of each feature.
  - Box plots to detect outliers and understand spread.

**Results & Insights:**  
- Petal length and petal width showed strong separation between species.  
- Sepal dimensions had overlapping distributions among some species.  
- Outliers were minimal and did not significantly affect the overall patterns.
